<p id="id00014" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00016">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00018">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<p id="id00019">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p id="id00020">At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00037">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p id="id00038">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00039">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p id="id00040">LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p id="id00041">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<h5 id="id00042">THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

<p id="id00043">Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.</p>

<p id="id00044">INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:

<p id="id00055" style="margin-top: 4em">Executive Director's Notes:</p>

<p id="id00056">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>

<p id="id00057">  Barnardo. Who's there?<br/>

  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br/>

your selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00058">   Bar. Long liue the King</p>

<p id="id00059">***</p>

<p id="id00060">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p>

<p id="id00061">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p id="id00062">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p id="id00063">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p>

<p id="id00064">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first
Part of Henry the Sixt.</p>

<p id="id00067" style="margin-top: 2em">Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.</p>

<p id="id00068">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p>

<p id="id00069">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p>

<p id="id00070">If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.</p>

<p id="id00089">  Lor. My Lord Bassanio, since you haue found Anthonio<br/>

We two will leaue you, but at dinner time<br/>

I pray you haue in minde where we must meete<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00090">   Bass. I will not faile you</p>

<p id="id00091">   Grat. You looke not well signior Anthonio,<br/>

You haue too much respect vpon the world:<br/>

They loose it that doe buy it with much care,<br/>

Beleeue me you are maruellously chang'd<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00092">   Ant. I hold the world but as the world Gratiano,<br/>

A stage, where euery man must play a part,<br/>

And mine a sad one<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00093">   Grati. Let me play the foole,<br/>

With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,<br/>

And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,<br/>

Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.<br/>

Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,<br/>

Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?<br/>

Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies<br/>

By being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,<br/>

I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:<br/>

There are a sort of men, whose visages<br/>

Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,<br/>

And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,<br/>

With purpose to be drest in an opinion<br/>

Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,<br/>

As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,<br/>

And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.<br/>

O my Anthonio, I do know of these<br/>

That therefore onely are reputed wise,<br/>

For saying nothing; when I am verie sure<br/>

If they should speake, would almost dam those eares<br/>

Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:<br/>

Ile tell thee more of this another time.<br/>

But fish not with this melancholly baite<br/>

For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:<br/>

Come good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,<br/>

Ile end my exhortation after dinner<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00094">   Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.<br/>

I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.<br/>

For Gratiano neuer let's me speake<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00095">   Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,<br/>

Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00096">   Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare</p>

<p id="id00097">   Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable<br/>

In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00098">  Ant. It is that any thing now</p>

<p id="id00099">   Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
seeke all day ere you finde them, &amp; when you haue them
they are not worth the search</p>

<p id="id00100">   An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same<br/>

To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage<br/>

That you to day promis'd to tel me of?<br/>

  Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio<br/>

How much I haue disabled mine estate,<br/>

By something shewing a more swelling port<br/>

Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:<br/>

Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd<br/>

From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care<br/>

Is to come fairely off from the great debts<br/>

Wherein my time something too prodigall<br/>

Hath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio<br/>

I owe the most in money, and in loue,<br/>

And from your loue I haue a warrantie<br/>

To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,<br/>

How to get cleere of all the debts I owe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00101">   An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,<br/>

And if it stand as you your selfe still do,<br/>

Within the eye of honour, be assur'd<br/>

My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes<br/>

Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00102">   Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft<br/>

I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight<br/>

The selfesame way, with more aduised watch<br/>

To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,<br/>

I oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,<br/>

Because what followes is pure innocence.<br/>

I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,<br/>

That which I owe is lost: but if you please<br/>

To shoote another arrow that selfe way<br/>

Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br/>

As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,<br/>

Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,<br/>

And thankfully rest debter for the first<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00103">   An. You know me well, and herein spend but time<br/>

To winde about my loue with circumstance,<br/>

And out of doubt you doe more wrong<br/>

In making question of my vttermost<br/>

Then if you had made waste of all I haue:<br/>

Then doe but say to me what I should doe<br/>

That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br/>

And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00104">   Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,<br/>

And she is faire, and fairer then that word,<br/>

Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes<br/>

I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:<br/>

Her name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd<br/>

To Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,<br/>

Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br/>

For the four windes blow in from euery coast<br/>

Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks<br/>

Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,<br/>

Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,<br/>

And many Iasons come in quest of her.<br/>

O my Anthonio, had I but the meanes<br/>

To hold a riuall place with one of them,<br/>

I haue a minde presages me such thrift,<br/>

That I should questionlesse be fortunate<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00105">   Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,<br/>

Neither haue I money, nor commodity<br/>

To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth<br/>

Try what my credit can in Venice doe,<br/>

That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,<br/>

To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.<br/>

Goe presently enquire, and so will I<br/>

Where money is, and I no question make<br/>

To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00106">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00107">Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.</p>

<p id="id00108" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie
of this great world</p>

<p id="id00109">   Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie
comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
liues longer</p>

<p id="id00110">   Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd</p>

<p id="id00111">   Ner. They would be better if well followed</p>

<p id="id00112">   Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were
good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie
what were good to be done, then be one of the twentie
to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise
lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter
curb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,
that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none</p>

<p id="id00113">   Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie
that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,
but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
suters that are already come?
  Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest
them, I will describe them, and according to my description
leuell at my affection</p>

<p id="id00114">   Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince</p>

<p id="id00115">   Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation
to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:
I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
with a Smyth</p>

<p id="id00116">   Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine</p>

<p id="id00117">   Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly
sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married
to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either
of these: God defend me from these two</p>

<p id="id00118">   Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
Le Boune?
  Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better
bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
to madnesse, I should neuer requite him</p>

<p id="id00119">   Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong
Baron of England?
  Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the Court &amp; sweare
that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a
proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet
in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where</p>

<p id="id00120">   Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?
  Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and
swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder
for another</p>

<p id="id00121">   Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of
Saxonies Nephew?
  Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst
fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
him</p>

<p id="id00122">   Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,
if you should refuse to accept him</p>

<p id="id00123">   Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,
for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa
ere I will be married to a spunge</p>

<p id="id00124">   Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,
which is indeede to returne to their home,
and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,
depending on the Caskets</p>

<p id="id00125">   Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as
chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure</p>

<p id="id00126">   Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that
came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?
  Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee
call'd</p>

<p id="id00127">   Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
Lady</p>

<p id="id00128">   Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy<br/>

of thy praise.<br/>

Enter a Seruingman.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00129">  Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,
the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his
Maister will be here to night</p>

<p id="id00130">   Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;
whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
knocks at the doore.</p>

<p id="id00131">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00132">Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.</p>

<p id="id00133">  Shy. Three thousand ducates, well</p>

<p id="id00134">   Bass. I sir, for three months</p>

<p id="id00135">   Shy. For three months, well</p>

<p id="id00136">   Bass. For the which, as I told you,<br/>

Anthonio shall be bound<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00137">   Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well</p>

<p id="id00138">   Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?<br/>

Shall I know your answere<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00139">   Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,<br/>

and Anthonio bound<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00140">   Bass. Your answere to that</p>

<p id="id00141">   Shy. Anthonio is a good man</p>

<p id="id00142">   Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary</p>

<p id="id00143">   Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,
yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie
bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand
moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,
a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding
sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
take his bond</p>

<p id="id00144">   Bas. Be assured you may</p>

<p id="id00145">   Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,<br/>

I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?<br/>

  Bass. If it please you to dine with vs<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00146">   Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation
which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell
into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with
you, walke with you, and so following: but I will
not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.
What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
Enter Anthonio.</p>

<p id="id00147">  Bass. This is signior Anthonio</p>

<p id="id00148">   Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.<br/>

I hate him for he is a Christian:<br/>

But more, for that in low simplicitie<br/>

He lends out money gratis, and brings downe<br/>

The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.<br/>

If I can catch him once vpon the hip,<br/>

I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.<br/>

He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes<br/>

Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate<br/>

On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,<br/>

Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe<br/>

If I forgiue him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00149">   Bass. Shylock, doe you heare</p>

<p id="id00150">   Shy. I am debating of my present store,<br/>

And by the neere gesse of my memorie<br/>

I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse<br/>

Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?<br/>

Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe<br/>

Will furnish me: but soft, how many months<br/>

Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,<br/>

Your worship was the last man in our mouthes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00151">   Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br/>

By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,<br/>

Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br/>

Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest<br/>

How much he would?<br/>

  Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00152">   Ant. And for three months</p>

<p id="id00153">   Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.<br/>

Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,<br/>

Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow<br/>

Vpon aduantage<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00154">   Ant. I doe neuer vse it</p>

<p id="id00155">   Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,<br/>

This Iacob from our holy Abram was<br/>

(As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)<br/>

The third possesser; I, he was the third<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00156">   Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?<br/>

  Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say<br/>

Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,<br/>

When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd<br/>

That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied<br/>

Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,<br/>

In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,<br/>

And when the worke of generation was<br/>

Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,<br/>

The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,<br/>

And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,<br/>

He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,<br/>

Who then conceauing, did in eaning time<br/>

Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.<br/>

This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:<br/>

And thrift is blessing if men steale it not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00157">   Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,<br/>

A thing not in his power to bring to passe,<br/>

But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.<br/>

Was this inserted to make interrest good?<br/>

Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?<br/>

  Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,<br/>

But note me signior<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00158">   Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,<br/>

The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,<br/>

An euill soule producing holy witnesse,<br/>

Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,<br/>

A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br/>

O what a goodly outside falsehood hath<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00159">   Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.<br/>

Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00160">   Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?<br/>

  Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft<br/>

In the Ryalto you haue rated me<br/>

About my monies and my vsances:<br/>

Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,<br/>

(For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)<br/>

You call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,<br/>

And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,<br/>

And all for vse of that which is mine owne.<br/>

Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:<br/>

Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,<br/>

Shylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:<br/>

You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,<br/>

And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre<br/>

Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.<br/>

What should I say to you? Should I not say,<br/>

Hath a dog money? Is it possible<br/>

A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or<br/>

Shall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key<br/>

With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,<br/>

Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;<br/>

You spurn'd me such a day; another time<br/>

You cald me dog: and for these curtesies<br/>

Ile lend you thus much moneyes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00161">   Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,<br/>

To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.<br/>

If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br/>

As to thy friends, for when did friendship take<br/>

A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?<br/>

But lend it rather to thine enemie,<br/>

Who if he breake, thou maist with better face<br/>

Exact the penalties<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00162">   Shy. Why looke you how you storme,<br/>

I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,<br/>

Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,<br/>

Supplie your present wants, and take no doite<br/>

Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,<br/>

This is kinde I offer<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00163">   Bass. This were kindnesse</p>

<p id="id00164">   Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,<br/>

Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there<br/>

Your single bond, and in a merrie sport<br/>

If you repaie me not on such a day,<br/>

In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br/>

Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite<br/>

Be nominated for an equall pound<br/>

Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken<br/>

In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00165">   Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,<br/>

And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00166">   Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,<br/>

Ile rather dwell in my necessitie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00167">   Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,<br/>

Within these two months, that's a month before<br/>

This bond expires, I doe expect returne<br/>

Of thrice three times the valew of this bond<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00168">   Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br/>

Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect<br/>

The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,<br/>

else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
reason? I am a Iewe: Hath not a Iew eyes? hath not a
Iew hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passions,
fed with the same foode, hurt with the same weapons,
subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not reuenge?
if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
in that. If a Iew wrong a Christian, what is his humility,
reuenge? If a Christian wrong a Iew, what should his sufferance
be by Christian example, why reuenge? The villanie
you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
but I will better the instruction.
Enter a man from Anthonio.</p>

<p id="id00367">Gentlemen, my maister Anthonio is at his house, and

Enter Tuball.<br/>

<p id="id00370">Exeunt. Gentlemen</p>

<p id="id00371">   Shy. How now Tuball, what newes from Genowa? hast<br/>

thou found my daughter?<br/>

  Tub. I often came where I did heare of her, but cannot<br/>

finde her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00372">   Shy. Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer
fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious
iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfaction,
no reuenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights
a my shoulders, no sighes but a my breathing, no teares
but a my shedding</p>

<p id="id00373">   Tub. Yes, other men haue ill lucke too, Anthonio as I<br/>

heard in Genowa?<br/>

  Shy. What, what, what, ill lucke, ill lucke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00374">   Tub. Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tripolis</p>

<p id="id00375">   Shy. I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?<br/>

  Tub. I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped<br/>

the wracke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00376">   Shy. I thanke thee good Tuball, good newes, good<br/>

newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00377">   Tub. Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one<br/>

night fourescore ducats<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00378">   Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my<br/>

gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore ducats<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00379">   Tub. There came diuers of Anthonios creditors in my
company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
breake</p>

<p id="id00380">   Shy. I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture<br/>

him, I am glad of it,<br/>

  Tub. One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of<br/>

your daughter for a Monkie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00381">   Shy. Out vpon her, thou torturest me Tuball, it was
my Turkies, I had it of Leah when I was a Batcheler: I
would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies</p>

<p id="id00382">   Tub. But Anthonio is certainely vndone</p>

<p id="id00383">   Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe Tuball, see
me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice,
I can make what merchandize I will: goe Tuball,
and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good Tuball, at our
Sinagogue Tuball.</p>

<p id="id00384">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00385">Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine.</p>

<p id="id00386">  Por. I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two<br/>

Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong<br/>

I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,<br/>

There's something tels me (but it is not loue)<br/>

I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,<br/>

Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;<br/>

But least you should not vnderstand me well,<br/>

And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,<br/>

I would detaine you here some month or two<br/>

Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br/>

How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,<br/>

So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,<br/>

But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,<br/>

That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,<br/>

They haue ore-lookt me and deuided me,<br/>

One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,<br/>

Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,<br/>

And so all yours; O these naughtie times<br/>

Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.<br/>

And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)<br/>

Let Fortune goe to hell for it, not I.<br/>

I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,<br/>

To ich it, and to draw it out in length,<br/>

To stay you from election<br/>

For as I am, I liue vpon the racke<br/>

What treason there is mingled with your loue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00389">   Bass. None but that vglie treason of mistrust.<br/>

Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:<br/>

There may as well be amitie and life,<br/>

'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00392">   Por. Well then, confesse and liue</p>

<p id="id00393">   Bass. Confesse and loue<br/>

Had beene the verie sum of my confession:<br/>

O happie torment, when my torturer<br/>

Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:<br/>

But let me to my fortune and the caskets<br/>

If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.<br/>

Nerryssa and the rest, stand all aloofe,<br/>

Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,<br/>

Then if he loose he makes a Swan-like end,<br/>

Fading in musique. That the comparison<br/>

May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame<br/>

And watrie death-bed for him: he may win,<br/>

And what is musique than? Than musique is<br/>

Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe<br/>

To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,<br/>

As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,<br/>

That creepe into the dreaming bride-groomes eare,<br/>

And summon him to marriage. Now he goes<br/>

With no lesse presence, but with much more loue<br/>

Then yong Alcides, when he did redeeme<br/>

The virgine tribute, paied by howling Troy<br/>

To the Sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,<br/>

The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:<br/>

With bleared visages come forth to view<br/>

<p id="id00397">   All. Ding, dong, bell</p>

<p id="id00398">   Bass. So may the outward showes be least themselues<br/>

The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.<br/>

In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,<br/>

But being season'd with a gracious voice,<br/>

Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,<br/>

What damned error, but some sober brow<br/>

Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,<br/>

Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:<br/>

There is no voice so simple, but assumes<br/>

Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;<br/>

How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br/>

As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins<br/>

The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,<br/>

Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,<br/>

And these assume but valors excrement,<br/>

To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,<br/>

And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,<br/>

Which therein workes a miracle in nature,<br/>

Making them lightest that weare most of it:<br/>

So are those crisped snakie golden locks<br/>

Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde<br/>

Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne<br/>

To be the dowrie of a second head,<br/>

The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.<br/>

Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br/>

To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe<br/>

Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,<br/>

The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br/>

To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,<br/>

Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,<br/>

Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge<br/>

'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead<br/>

Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,<br/>

Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,<br/>

And here choose I, ioy be the consequence<br/>

<p id="id00399">   Por. How all the other passions fleet to ayre,<br/>

As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:<br/>

O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,<br/>

In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,<br/>

Faire Portias counterfeit. What demie God<br/>

Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?<br/>

Or whether riding on the bals of mine<br/>

Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips<br/>

Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre<br/>

Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires<br/>

The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen<br/>

A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men<br/>

Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,<br/>

How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,<br/>

Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his<br/>

And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre<br/>

The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br/>

In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow<br/>

Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,<br/>

The continent, and summarie of my fortune.<br/>

You that choose not by the view<br/>

Chance as faire, and choose as true:<br/>

Since this fortune fals to you,<br/>

Be content, and seeke no new.<br/>

If you be well pleasd with this,<br/>

And hold your fortune for your blisse,<br/>

Turne you where your Lady is,<br/>

And claime her with a louing kisse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00401">   Bass. A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,<br/>

I come by note to giue, and to receiue,<br/>

Like one of two contending in a prize<br/>

That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:<br/>

Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,<br/>

Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br/>

Whether those peales of praise be his or no.<br/>

So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,<br/>

As doubtfull whether what I see be true,<br/>

Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00402">   Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,<br/>

Such as I am; though for my selfe alone<br/>

I would not be ambitious in my wish,<br/>

To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,<br/>

I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,<br/>

A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times<br/>

More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,<br/>

I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,<br/>

Exceed account: but the full summe of me<br/>

Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,<br/>

Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,<br/>

Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br/>

But she may learne: happier then this,<br/>

Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;<br/>

Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit<br/>

Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,<br/>

As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.<br/>

My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours<br/>

Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord<br/>

Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,<br/>

Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,<br/>

This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe<br/>

Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,<br/>

Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,<br/>

Let it presage the ruine of your loue,<br/>

And be my vantage to exclaime on you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00403">   Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,<br/>

Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,<br/>

And there is such confusion in my powers,<br/>

As after some oration fairely spoke<br/>

By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare<br/>

Among the buzzing pleased multitude,<br/>

Where euery something being blent together,<br/>

Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy<br/>

Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring<br/>

Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,<br/>

O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00404">   Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time<br/>

That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,<br/>

To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady<br/>

<p id="id00405">   Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,<br/>

I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:<br/>

For I am sure you can wish none from me:<br/>

And when your Honours meane to solemnize<br/>

The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you<br/>

Euen at that time I may be married too<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00406">   Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife</p>

<p id="id00407">   Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.<br/>

My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:<br/>

You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:<br/>

You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,<br/>

No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;<br/>

Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,<br/>

And so did mine too, as the matter falls:<br/>

For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,<br/>

And swearing till my very rough was dry<br/>

With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,<br/>

I got a promise of this faire one heere<br/>

To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune<br/>

Atchieu'd her mistresse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00408">   Por. Is this true Nerrissa?<br/>

  Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall<br/>

downe.<br/>

But who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?<br/>

What and my old Venetian friend Salerio?<br/>

Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00413">  Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,<br/>

If that the youth of my new interest heere<br/>

Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue<br/>

I bid my verie friends and Countrimen<br/>

<p id="id00415">   Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,<br/>

My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,<br/>

But meeting with Salerio by the way,<br/>

He did intreate mee past all saying nay<br/>

To come with him along<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00416">   Sal. I did my Lord,<br/>

And I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio<br/>

Commends him to you<br/>

<p id="id00417">   Bass. Ere I ope his Letter<br/>

I pray you tell me how my good friend doth<br/>

<p id="id00418">   Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,<br/>

Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there<br/>

Wil shew you his estate.<br/>

<p id="id00419">Opens the Letter.</p>

<p id="id00420">  Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.<br/>

Your hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?<br/>

How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;<br/>

I know he will be glad of our successe,<br/>

We are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00421">   Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath<br/>

lost<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00422">   Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same<br/>

Paper,<br/>

That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,<br/>

Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world<br/>

Could turne so much the constitution<br/>

Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?<br/>

With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,<br/>

And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing<br/>

That this same paper brings you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00423">   Bass. O sweet Portia,<br/>

Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words<br/>

That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie<br/>

When I did first impart my loue to you,<br/>

I freely told you all the wealth I had<br/>

Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,<br/>

And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,<br/>

Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see<br/>

How much I was a Braggart, when I told you<br/>

My state was nothing, I should then haue told you<br/>

That I was worse then nothing: for indeede<br/>

I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,<br/>

Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie<br/>

To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,<br/>

The paper as the bodie of my friend,<br/>

And euerie word in it a gaping wound<br/>

Issuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,<br/>

Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,<br/>

From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br/>

From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,<br/>

And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch<br/>

Of Merchant-marring rocks?<br/>

  Sal. Not one my Lord.<br/>

Besides, it should appeare, that if he had<br/>

The present money to discharge the Iew,<br/>

He would not take it: neuer did I know<br/>

A creature that did beare the shape of man<br/>

So keene and greedy to confound a man.<br/>

He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,<br/>

And doth impeach the freedome of the state<br/>

If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,<br/>

The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes<br/>

Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,<br/>

But none can driue him from the enuious plea<br/>

Of forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00424">   Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare<br/>

To Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,<br/>

That he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,<br/>

Then twenty times the value of the summe<br/>

That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,<br/>

If law, authoritie, and power denie not,<br/>

It will goe hard with poore Anthonio<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00425">   Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?<br/>

  Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,<br/>

The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit<br/>

In doing curtesies: and one in whom<br/>

The ancient Romane honour more appeares<br/>

Then any that drawes breath in Italie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00426">   Por. What summe owes he the Iew?<br/>

  Bass. For me three thousand ducats<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00427">   Por. What, no more?<br/>

Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:<br/>

Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,<br/>

Before a friend of this description<br/>

Shall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.<br/>

First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,<br/>

And then away to Venice to your friend:<br/>

For neuer shall you lie by Portias side<br/>

With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold<br/>

To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.<br/>

When it is payd, bring your true friend along,<br/>

My maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time<br/>

Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,<br/>

For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:<br/>

Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,<br/>

Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.<br/>

But let me heare the letter of your friend.<br/>

Sweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors<br/>

grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is<br/>

forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all<br/>

debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my<br/>

death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not<br/>

perswade you to come, let not my letter<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00428">   Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone</p>

<p id="id00429">   Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,<br/>

But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,<br/>

How true a Gentleman you send releefe,<br/>

There must be needs a like proportion<br/>

Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;<br/>

Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio<br/>

Being the bosome louer of my Lord,<br/>

Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,<br/>

How little is the cost I haue bestowed<br/>

In purchasing the semblance of my soule;<br/>

From out the state of hellish cruelty,<br/>

This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,<br/>

but a kinde of bastard hope neither</p>

<p id="id00459">   Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?<br/>

  Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father<br/>

got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter<br/>

this making of Christians will raise the price of

in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
you are no good member of the common wealth, for
in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
of Porke</p>

<p id="id00466">   Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,
than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:
the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?

indeed more then I tooke her for</p>

But say it is my humor; Is it answered?<br/>

What if my house be troubled with a Rat,<br/>

Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?<br/>

Why he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force<br/>

Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,<br/>

came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor
of Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with
the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio
the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is
furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,
the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in
my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment
to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so
yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.

Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law<br/>

Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.<br/>

You stand within his danger, do you not?<br/>

  Ant. I, so he sayes<br/>

<p id="id00505">   Por. Do you confesse the bond?<br/>

  Ant. I do<br/>

<p id="id00507">   Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that</p>

<p id="id00508">   Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,<br/>

It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen<br/>

Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,<br/>

It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,<br/>

'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes<br/>

The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.<br/>

His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,<br/>

The attribute to awe and Maiestie,<br/>

Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:<br/>

But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,<br/>

It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,<br/>

It is an attribute to God himselfe;<br/>

And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods<br/>

When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,<br/>

Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,<br/>

That in the course of Iustice, none of vs<br/>

Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,<br/>

And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render<br/>

The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much<br/>

To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:<br/>

Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice<br/>

Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there<br/>

  Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,<br/>

Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,<br/>

I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,<br/>

On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<br/>

If this will not suffice, it must appeare<br/>

That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you<br/>

Wrest once the Law to your authority.<br/>

To do a great right, do a little wrong,<br/>

And curbe this cruell diuell of his will<br/>

Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:<br/>

sola,<br/>

  Lor. Leaue hollowing man, heere<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00613">   Clo. Sola, where, where?<br/>

  Lor. Heere?<br/>

  Clo. Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with<br/>

his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere<br/>

morning sweete soule<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00614">   Loren. Let's in, and there expect their comming.<br/>

And yet no matter: why should we goe in?<br/>

My friend Stephen, signifie pray you<br/>

Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,<br/>

And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.<br/>

How sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,<br/>

Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke<br/>

Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night<br/>

Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:<br/>

Sit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen<br/>

Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,<br/>

There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst<br/>

But in his motion like an Angell sings,<br/>

Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;<br/>

Such harmonie is in immortall soules,<br/>

But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br/>

Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:<br/>

Come hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,<br/>

With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,<br/>

And draw her home with musicke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00615">   Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.</p>

<p id="id00616">Play musicke.</p>

<p id="id00617">  Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:<br/>

For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard<br/>

Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,<br/>

Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br/>

Which is the hot condition of their bloud,<br/>

If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,<br/>

Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,<br/>

You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,<br/>

Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,<br/>

By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet<br/>

Did faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.<br/>

Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br/>

But musicke for time doth change his nature,<br/>

The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,<br/>

Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,<br/>

Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,<br/>

The motions of his spirit are dull as night,<br/>

And his affections darke as Erobus,<br/>

Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.<br/>

Enter Portia and Nerrissa.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00618">  Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:<br/>

How farre that little candell throwes his beames,<br/>

So shines a good deed in a naughty world<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00619">   Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?<br/>

  Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,<br/>

A substitute shines brightly as a King<br/>

Vntill a King be by, and then his state<br/>

Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke<br/>

Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00620">Musicke.</p>

<p id="id00621">  Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house</p>

<p id="id00622">   Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,<br/>

Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?<br/>

  Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00623">   Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke<br/>

When neither is attended: and I thinke<br/>

The Nightingale if she should sing by day<br/>

When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought<br/>

No better a Musitian then the Wren?<br/>

How many things by season, season'd are<br/>

To their right praise, and true perfection:<br/>

Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,<br/>

And would not be awak'd.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00624">Musicke ceases.</p>

<p id="id00625">  Lor. That is the voice,<br/>

Or I am much deceiu'd of Portia<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00626">   Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the<br/>

Cuckow by the bad voice?<br/>

  Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?<br/>

  Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare<br/>

Which speed we hope the better for our words,<br/>

Are they return'd?<br/>

  Lor. Madam, they are not yet:<br/>

But there is come a Messenger before<br/>

To signifie their comming<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00627">   Por. Go in Nerrissa,<br/>

Giue order to my seruants, that they take<br/>

No note at all of our being absent hence,<br/>

Nor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00628">A Tucket sounds.</p>

<p id="id00629">  Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,<br/>

We are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00630">   Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,<br/>

It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,<br/>

Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.<br/>

Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00631">  Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,<br/>

If you would walke in absence of the sunne<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00632">   Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,<br/>

For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,<br/>

And neuer be Bassanio so for me,<br/>

But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00633">   Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend<br/>

This is the man, this is Anthonio,<br/>

To whom I am so infinitely bound<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00634">   Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,<br/>

For as I heare he was much bound for you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00635">   Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of</p>

<p id="id00636">   Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:<br/>

It must appeare in other waies then words,<br/>

Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00637">   Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,<br/>

Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,<br/>

Would he were gelt that had it for my part,<br/>

Since you do take it Loue so much at hart<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00638">   Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?<br/>

  Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring<br/>

That she did giue me, whose Poesie was<br/>

For all the world like Cutlers Poetry<br/>

Vpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00639">   Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:<br/>

You swore to me when I did giue it you,<br/>

That you would weare it til the houre of death,<br/>

And that it should lye with you in your graue,<br/>

Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br/>

You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.<br/>

Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know<br/>

The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00640">   Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man</p>

<p id="id00641">   Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man</p>

<p id="id00642">   Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,<br/>

A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<br/>

No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,<br/>

A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,<br/>

I could not for my heart deny it him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00643">   Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,<br/>

To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,<br/>

A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,<br/>

And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.<br/>

I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare<br/>

Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:<br/>

I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,<br/>

Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth<br/>

That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,<br/>

You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,<br/>

And 'twere to me I should be mad at it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00644">   Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,<br/>

And sweare I lost the Ring defending it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00645">   Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away<br/>

Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede<br/>

Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke<br/>

That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,<br/>

And neyther man nor master would take ought<br/>

But the two Rings<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00646">   Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?<br/>

Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00647">   Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,<br/>

I would deny it: but you see my finger<br/>

Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00648">   Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.<br/>

By heauen I wil nere come in your bed<br/>

Vntil I see the Ring<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00649">   Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine</p>

<p id="id00650">   Bass. Sweet Portia,<br/>

If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,<br/>

If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,<br/>

And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,<br/>

And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,<br/>

When nought would be accepted but the Ring,<br/>

You would abate the strength of your displeasure?<br/>

  Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,<br/>

Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,<br/>

Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,<br/>

You would not then haue parted with the Ring:<br/>

What man is there so much vnreasonable,<br/>

If you had pleas'd to haue defended it<br/>

With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie<br/>

To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:<br/>

Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,<br/>

Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?<br/>

  Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule<br/>

No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,<br/>

Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,<br/>

And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,<br/>

And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:<br/>

Euen he that had held vp the verie life<br/>

Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?<br/>

I was inforc'd to send it after him,<br/>

I was beset with shame and curtesie,<br/>

My honor would not let ingratitude<br/>

So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,<br/>

And by these blessed Candles of the night,<br/>

Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd<br/>

The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?<br/>

  Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,<br/>

Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,<br/>

And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,<br/>

I will become as liberall as you,<br/>

Ile not deny him any thing I haue,<br/>

No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:<br/>

Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.<br/>

Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,<br/>

If you doe not, if I be left alone,<br/>

Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,<br/>

Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00651">   Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd<br/>

How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00652">   Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,<br/>

For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00653">   Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels</p>

<p id="id00654">   Por. Sir, grieue not you,<br/>

You are welcome notwithstanding<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00655">   Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,<br/>

And in the hearing of these manie friends<br/>

I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes<br/>

Wherein I see my selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00656">   Por. Marke you but that?<br/>

In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:<br/>

In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,<br/>

And there's an oath of credit<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00657">   Bas. Nay, but heare me.<br/>

Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare<br/>

I neuer more will breake an oath with thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00658">   Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,<br/>

Which but for him that had your husbands ring<br/>

Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,<br/>

My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord<br/>

Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00659">   Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,<br/>

And bid him keepe it better then the other<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00660">   Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring</p>

<p id="id00661">   Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor</p>

<p id="id00662">   Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,<br/>

For by this ring the Doctor lay with me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00663">   Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,<br/>

For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke<br/>

In liew of this, last night did lye with me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00664">   Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies<br/>

In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:<br/>

What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00665">   Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;<br/>

Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,<br/>

It comes from Padua from Bellario,<br/>

There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,<br/>

Nerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere<br/>

Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,<br/>

And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet<br/>

Entred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,<br/>

And I haue better newes in store for you<br/>

Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,<br/>

There you shall finde three of your Argosies<br/>

Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.<br/>

You shall not know by what strange accident<br/>

I chanced on this letter<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00666">   Antho. I am dumbe</p>

<p id="id00667">   Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?<br/>

  Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00668">   Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,<br/>

Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00669">   Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,<br/>

When I am absent, then lie with my wife<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00670">   An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life &amp; liuing;<br/>

For heere I reade for certaine that my ships<br/>

Are safelie come to Rode<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00671">   Por. How now Lorenzo?<br/>

My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00672">   Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.<br/>

There doe I giue to you and Iessica<br/>

From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift<br/>

After his death, of all he dies possess'd of<br/>

<p id="id00673">   Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way<br/>

Of starued people<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00674">   Por. It is almost morning,<br/>

And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br/>

Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,<br/>

And charge vs there vpon intergatories,<br/>

And we will answer all things faithfully<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00675">   Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory<br/>

That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,<br/>

Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<br/>

Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,<br/>

But were the day come, I should wish it darke,<br/>

Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.<br/>

Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing<br/>

So sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.<br/>
